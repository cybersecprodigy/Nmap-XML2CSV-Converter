# Nmap XML to CSV Converter

This Python script converts Nmap XML scan results into CSV format. It parses the XML file generated by Nmap and extracts information about scanned hosts, including IP addresses, hostnames, open ports, services, and their states. The converted CSV file provides a structured view of the Nmap scan data, which can be easily analyzed and manipulated using spreadsheet software or other tools.

## Features

- Parses Nmap XML scan results.
- Extracts information about scanned hosts, including IP addresses, hostnames, open ports, services, and their states.
- Converts the scan data into CSV format.
- Supports easy analysis and manipulation of scan data using spreadsheet software or other tools.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `xml.etree.ElementTree` module
- `csv` module

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
3. Run the script `nmap_xml_to_csv.py` with the following command:

python nmap_xml_to_csv.py <path_to_nmap_xml_file> <output_csv_file>

Replace `<path_to_nmap_xml_file>` with the path to your Nmap XML file, and `<output_csv_file>` with the desired path for the output CSV file.

## Example

Suppose you have an Nmap XML file named `nmap_scan.xml` and you want to convert it to CSV format. You can run the following command:

python nmap_xml_to_csv.py nmap_scan.xml nmap_scan.csv


This will convert the `nmap_scan.xml` file to CSV format and save the output as `nmap_scan.csv` in the same directory.
